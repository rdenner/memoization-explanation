# Memoization Explanation

This repo is intended to be used during a presentation to show how React handles updates in different scenarios.

## What is Memoization?

Why calculate something that is given the same input?

Memoization helps performance by remembering what the results were for specific inputs.

You should always profile to see if it actually made a difference.

Memoization can be a hit to performance if used incorrectly.
